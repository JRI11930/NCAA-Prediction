# 📌 Prediction of NCAA Basketball Game Winners

## 📜 Executive Summary
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the winner of NCAA basketball games based on historical data. Through data analysis, feature engineering, and classification model implementation, we seek to identify patterns in past matches and improve the accuracy of our predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives and Target Audience
### **Objectives**
- Develop a predictive model based on historical NCAA game data.
- Identify the most relevant variables to determine the winner of a match.
- Evaluate different modeling approaches and compare their performance.

### **Target Audience**
This project is intended for:
- **Sports data analysts** interested in applying predictive models to sports.
- **Basketball enthusiasts** who want to understand which factors influence team performance.
- **Data Science professionals and students** looking for a practical case study to enhance their skills in data analysis and predictive modeling.

## 🏀 Problem Definition
Predicting results in sports events is a complex challenge that involves multiple variables and external factors. In this project, we address the **prediction of the winning team in an NCAA match**. To achieve this, we will utilize historical match data, including team performance statistics, game location, and other factors that may influence the final outcome.
